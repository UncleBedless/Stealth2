  <h2 class="font">Music is a beautiful form of art that we believe everyone should be able to experience. But with 1.5 billion people being Auditorily Impaired, it makes it difficult to enjoy music. So what if you want to enjoy music without paying the hefty price of hearing aids(8000$)?
    Lucky for you, this is exactly what our project is about. We want to make a headphone that helps people that have trouble hearing enjoy music for 80 times less the price.
